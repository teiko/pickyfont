I'm getting old. 
My old, default for a very long time, beloved terminus font doesn't cut it
anymore where I really need to see what I'm doing.
Programming is such a task, when I need to see what I do. I still use the small
terminus font in all other shells, but I wanted a slightly bigger one in vim.

I found no easy way of changing the console font on the fly, so I came up with
this. Feel free to suggest other 'programming' fonts that rocks!
